	<h3>My Grandfather's Talus</h3>
	<p>Over 80 years ago, my granfather was given this talus by his grandfather on his 14th birthday. My grandfather recently passed it to me and told me the story of his bar mitzvah, which occured at a synagoge on the corner of Lawernce Ave and Lawndale Ave in Albany Park, Chiacgo. I mounted the cloth on a wooden frame with freely rotating joints. I took it to the site of this former synagogue, which has been replaced by a food and liquor store. After filming the sculpture, I dismantled it to keep the cloth perserved. May, 2013.<p>
