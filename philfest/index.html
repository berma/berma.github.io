	<h3>PHILFEST MUD STENCIL</h3>
	<p>Over 80 years ago, my grandfather was given this talus by his grandfather on his 14th birthday. When my grandfather gave it to me, he remembered that his bar mitzvah took place at a synagoge on the corner of Lawernce Ave and Lawndale Ave in Albany Park, Chiacgo. <br><br>I took the cloth and mounted it on a wooden frame with freely rotating joints. I then brought it to the site of this former synagogue, now a food and liquor store. After filming the sculpture, I dismantled it to keep the cloth perserved.<p>
